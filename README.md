# Mixed Messages
Mixed Messages is a tutorial project using Javascript, Github, and Node.js that came from the Full Stack Engineer course on [Codecademy](Codecademy.com). 

This version of the project will set up a Dungeon World RPG system *Random Front Generator*. A Front is an organized collection of dangers known by a game master and set in opposition to the players. Ideally, a game master can expand the details and scope of a random front to generate an adventure for their players.

This script draws from set arrays containing the pieces of each Front, and returns a random:

1. Adventure Danger
2. Impeding Doom
3. A Grim Portent
4. A Stakes Question

Dungeon World is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game created by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel.
